 * [Environments](https://www.datocms.com/docs/general-concepts/primary-and-sandbox-environments) make it easier for your development team to **manage and maintain content structure once your content has been published**. You can think of environments like code branches: great for testing, development and pre-production environments.
 *
 * By default, every project has one environment, called **primary environment**, which is meant to be used for the regular editorial workflow. Additionally, multiple **sandbox environments** can be created by developers to safely test/experiment new changes in the content.
 *
 * Sandbox environments start out as **exact copies of one of the existing environments** (ie. the primary one). The process of creating a new sandbox starting off from an existing environment is called fork.
 *
 * Each environment is identified by a name (ie. `master`) and stores the following information:
 *
 * - Models
 * - Records
 * - Uploads
 * - Plugins
 * - Locales and timezone settings
 * - UI Theme (colors and logo)
 * - Global SEO settings
 * - The content navigation bar
 *
 * When making changes to any of the aforementioned entities in any environment, including the primary environment, **the data in all other environments isn’t affected** and stays the same.
