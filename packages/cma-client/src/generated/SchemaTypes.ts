/**
 * DatoCMS offers a number of different fields that you can combine togheter to create a [Model](/docs/content-management-api/resources/item-type). Using the database metaphore, fields are like table columns, and when creating them you need to specify their type (`string`, `float`, etc.) and any required validation.
 *
 * ### Different field types require different settings
 *
 * When looking at a field resource, you have to pay attention to two particular properties, `validators` and `appearance`.
 *
 * The `validators` property expresses the set of validations to be performed server-side on a specific field value for it to be considered valid, while the `appearance` property lets you specify _how_ the field itself will be presented inside the form to the final editor.
 *
 * For both properties, the value to specify depends on the type of field itself. For example, you can add a "Limit character count" validation to a _Single-line string_ field, or set its appearence to "Show it as heading", but they won't be accepted for a ie. _Color_ field, as it supports different validations and appearance settings.
 *
 * ### Specifying validations
 *
 * The `validators` property requires an object whose keys are the validations that you want to be enforced, and the values are objects representing any settings that the validation itself requires. If the validation doesn't have additional settings, you just pass down an empty object.
 *
 * This is a valid example for a _Single-line string_ field:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   "validators": {
 *     // "required" validator has no settings
 *     "required": {},
 *     // "length" validator requires "min" and/or "max" properties
 *     "length": { "min": 80 }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Below you'll find a summary of all the validators available for each field type with their settings.
 *
 * Some validators are required for a specific type of field. For example, the _Slug_ field needs to have a `slug_title_field` validator to specify the ID of the _Single-line string_ field that will be used to generate the slug itself.
 *
 * ### Specifying the appearance
 *
 * The `appearance` property requires an object with three specific properties: `editor`, `parameters` and `addons`.
 *
 * The `editor` represents the type of editor that the users will see inside the form to change the value of this specific field. Depending on the type of field, DatoCMS offers a number of different editors for you to choose from. The `parameters` property is an object representing any additional settings that the editor itself might require.
 *
 * This is a valid example for a _Single-line string_ field:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   "appearance": {
 *     // single_line is a DatoCMS built-in editor that you can use with single-line string fields
 *     "editor": "single_line",
 *     // each built-in editor has specific settings
 *     "parameters": { "heading": true },
 *     "addons": []
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Following you'll find a summary of all the editors available for each field type with their settings.
 *
 * #### Setting the appearance to a field editor provided by a plugin
 *
 * If the project contains a plugin that exposes [manual field editors](/docs/plugin-sdk/manual-field-extensions), you can also configure the field to be presented with it instead of using one of the build-in editors.
 *
 * In this case:
 *
 * - the `editor` property must be the ID of the plugin;
 * - the `field_extension` property must be the ID of the specific manual field editor that the plugin exposes;
 * - the `parameters` property must provide a configuration object compatible with the [config screen of the manual field extension](/docs/plugin-sdk/manual-field-extensions#add-per-field-config-screens-to-manual-field-extensions), or an empty object if it doesn't require any configuration.
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   "appearance": {
 *     // "2132" is a the ID of a plugin exposing a manual field editor
 *     "editor": "2134",
 *     // "starRating" is a manual field editor exposed by the plugin
 *     "field_extension": "starRating",
 *     // this is a valid configuration for the "starRating" field editor
 *     "parameters": { "maxRating": 5, "starsColor": "#ff0000" },
 *     "addons": []
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configuring manual field addons
 *
 * If the project contains plugins that expose [manual field addons](/docs/plugin-sdk/manual-field-extensions), you can also add them to the field via the `addons` property.
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   "appearance": {
 *     "editor": "single_line",
 *     "parameters": { "heading": true },
 *     "addons": [
 *       {
 *         // "2138" is a the ID of a plugin exposing a manual addon editor
 *         "id": "2138",
 *         // "loremIpsumGenerator" is a manual field addon exposed by the plugin
 *         "field_extension": "loremIpsumGenerator",
 *         // this is a valid configuration for the "loremIpsumGenerator" field addon
 *         "parameters": { "sentences": 2 },
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   },
 * }
 * ```

You can think of environments like code branches: great for testing, development and pre-production environments.
 *
 * By default, every project has one environment, called **primary environment**, which is meant to be used for the regular editorial workflow. Additionally, multiple **sandbox environments** can be created by developers to safely test/experiment new changes in the content.
 *
 * Sandbox environments start out as **exact copies of one of the existing environments** (ie. the primary one). The process of creating a new sandbox starting off from an existing environment is called fork.
 *
 * Each environment is identified by a name (ie. `master`) and stores the following information:
 *
 * - Models
 * - Records
 * - Uploads
 * - Plugins
 * - Locales and timezone settings
 * - UI Theme (colors and logo)
 * - Global SEO settings
 * - The content navigation bar
 *
 * When making changes to any of the aforementioned entities in any environment, including the primary environment, **the data in all other environments isn’t affected** and stays the same.
